# caom2sandbox
CAOM service deployment for the CADC data engineering sandbox system

You are free to fork this code and use it as a starting point for implementing services, but at this time
we do not expect to produce applications that will work as-is in any environment or to document the system
dependencies that would be required. This is really just an example for developers of how to put the various 
libraries together into working services.
