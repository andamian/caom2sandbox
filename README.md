# caom2sandbox
CAOM service deployment for the CADC data engineering sandbox system

You are free to fork this code and use it as a starting point for implementing services, but at this time
we do not expect to produce applictions that will work as-is in any environment or to document the system
dependencies so that might be the case. This is really just an example of how to put the various libraries 
together into working services.
